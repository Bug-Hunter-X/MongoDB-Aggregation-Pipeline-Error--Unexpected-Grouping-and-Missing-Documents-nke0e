# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. The issue involves an incorrect pipeline setup leading to unexpected data grouping and potentially missing documents in the results.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code shows an aggregation pipeline designed to join two collections, unwind the results, and then group the data.  However, the `$group` stage is incorrectly configured, resulting in documents being lost or grouped incorrectly.  The `_id` field in the `$group` stage should be properly selected to reflect the desired grouping behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves correcting the `$group` stage to correctly specify the `_id` field. The corrected pipeline ensures accurate grouping and avoids data loss.

## How to Reproduce
1. Set up MongoDB and create sample collections.
2. Run the `bug.js` script to observe the incorrect results.
3. Run the `bugSolution.js` script to see the corrected behavior.
